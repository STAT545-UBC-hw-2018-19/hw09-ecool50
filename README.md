# Homework 09 Elijah Willie

This repo contains my solutions to STAT 545 homework 09. For this assignment, I took a previously developed makefile and added some new functionalities.
These functionalities are described below.

# New functionalities

* Computed three letter prefixes for all the english words.
* Plotted a histogram of the top `30` most frequent prefixes.
* Plotted a word map for all the prefixes.
* Added a demonstration in a seperate README file
* Updated the makefile accordingly.

# Caveats
* Some of the work here may have been borrowed and modified from other sources.
* This was purely done to illustrate some ideas
* I take no credit for parts of the work that are not mine
* Let credit be given where it is due. Lets give to Ceasar what belongs to Ceasar
* The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](http://stat545.com/automation04_make-activity.html).
